## 3.3.*

Sorry, we have no idea what happened with those versions. It looks like they got released in a
non-conventional way — the `git` tags are not on the `master` branch anymore. We will not remove
them, but please switch to **3.4**.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

## 3.2.1

- Execution context changes:
	- Using pool's ThreadPoolExecutionContext in wallets and accounts for long running tasks,
	- Using MainExecutionContext in pools, wallets and accounts for immediately completed futures,
- Wallet caching: return completed future (resolved promises) based on cached accounts in `WalletPool::getWallet` method,
- Account caching: same as above for `AbstractWallet::getAccount` method,
- Lazy loading of internal transactions for ETH operations,
- Removed some logs from `BitcoinLikeStrategyUtxoPicker::filterWithOptimizeSize` because they were affecting
Wallet Daemon perfos on huge accounts,
- Add TTL cache on last blocks (wallet pool level) and on balances (on wallet level), the TTL is configurable
thanks to : `TTL_CACHE` and is defaulting to `DEFAULT_TTL_CACHE=30` which is inferior to mining frequency.


## 3.2.0

- Using new ETH v3 explorer's endpoint to get ERC20 accounts balance,

## 3.0.0

- Use direct call to `balanceOf` on ERC20 to get balance in tokens of an account.

## 2.8.0

### Tezos Integration:

#### Keychain:

- Tezos key derivation is based on [Edward's curve](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0010.md),
so normal (public) derivations are not supported, this is why the only derivation scheme which is supported now is `44'/<coin_type>'/<account_index>'/<node_index>'`,
- As a consequence of absence of derivation, resulting "derived" address from a keychain is a hash of the public key.
- Used hashing algorithm is [`Blake2b`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/blake2/blake2b.c).
- We support construction of accounts from both `Secp256k1` (`Base58`) extended public keys (prefixed with `xpub`) or from `Ed25519` (`Base58`) extended public keys (prefixed with `edpk`).

#### Wallet logic:

- Originated accounts are considered as sub-accounts of implicit accounts that originated them.

#### Explorer:

- The current default explorer used is Tzscan (used endpoint: https://api6.tzscan.io/v3).

#### Synchronizer:

- Synchronization of originated accounts comes right after the originator's account is synced.

#### Transactions:

- For the moment we only support `Transaction`, `Reveal`, `Origination` and `Delegation` operations, those are the ones relevant for us.
- Parsing and serialization of transaction is based on Zarith encoder/decoder (for more details refer to: http://tezos.gitlab.io/master/api/p2p.html#n-t
 implementation is located here : `core/src/bytes/zarith`).
- In Tezos, it is possible to have multiple operations in one transaction (e.g. `Reveal` + `Origination` or `Reveal` + `Transaction` ...),
 since each operation has it's own properties (fees, gas limit, storage limit ...) that user should set, so we probably won't handle multi-operation transactions.
 This will be discussed with Libcore's users (e.g. Live team) to see if it is relevant to support multi-operation transactions.

#### Delegation:

- To delegate simply build a `Delegation` transaction with address to which delegate as receiver.

#### Parameters:

- BIP44 Coin type : `1729`.
- Used address prefixes:
	- Implicit (prefix `tz1`): `{0x06, 0xA1, 0x9F}`.
	- Originated (prefix `KT1`): `{0x02, 0x5A, 0x79}`.
- Default explorer's endpoint: https://api6.tzscan.io/v3

#### Tests:

- Added tests:
	- Address derivation: `core/test/tezos`.
	- Zarith encoder: `core/test/bytes/zarith.cpp`.
	- Account creation and synchronization: `core/test/integration/synchronization/tezos_synchronization.cpp`.
	- Transaction construction: `core/test/integration/transactions/tezos_transaction_tests.cpp`.

## 2.7.0

> 2019/05/19

- Change encoding of passwords in the public interface (wallet pool). Passwords are not optional
  anymore. This means that:
    - `Optional::NONE` and `Optional("")` (that were both ambiguity encoding) are now replaced by
      the empty string.
    - Because the empty string is used to state _no password_, empty passwords cannot be used
      anymore. The previous situation was that empty passwords were allowed but transformed into a
      `Optional::NONE`, which was a bit confusing.
- Native Segwit support:
    - Implement P2WPKH and P2WSH keychains, references:
        - BIP141: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#P2WSH
        - BIP143: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki
    - Support of Bech32 addresses, references:
         - BIP173: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki#Segwit_address_format)
         - BTC Bech32: https://github.com/sipa/bech32/tree/master/ref
         - BCH Bech32: https://github.com/bitcoincashjs/cashaddrjs
- Add `ERC20LikeAccount::getBalanceHistoryFor`, a method used to retrieve the balance history of an
  ERC20 account using inclusive date ranges.
- Fix some bugs related to JNI when compiling for Java / Android.
- The library now builds with a compiled version of
  [SQLCipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) and the Windows code-path is now patched.
- Improve the cross-compilation support of the library to allow to compile to several platforms in
  parallel. This is not perfect and needs a few more love to be complete but we’re getting there.
  This is especially useful when compiling for mobile (emulator x86, several variations of ARM
  depending on your phone, etc.).
- XRP is fully integrated.
- Full support of password change with `WalletPool::changePassword`. It is now possible to change
  one’s password by calling this function. The previous work from 2.6.0 that wasn’t exposed is now
  exposed and calling that function will change both the encryption on the database and the
  preferences.
- Some Windows-related fix (compilers, mostly).
- [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) is now a submodule of ours.
- Allow using compact pub keys for ethereum accounts.

## 2.6.0

> 2019/02/22

- Change the internal representation of `DynamicObject`. The new representation is optimized not
  only memory-wise but also type-safety-wise. The internal interfaces were also redesigned to allow
  for a smoother transition to C++17’s `std::variant` when we see fit.
- Add support for changing password in `Preferences`. This is not exposed directly via the
  interface: instead, you must use the password changing mechanisme of `WalletPool`. See below for
  further details.
- Implement sqlite3 database encryption through SQLCipher (https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher). If the
  `WalletPool::newInstance` is used with native (sqlite3) backend and called with a password (non-empty string),
  the database will be encrypted. To change password, a `changeDatabasePassword` is provided.
  SQLCipher is not available for Windows builds mainly because of build issues (C compiler containing spaces).
- Changed deployement process, now RCs are deployed with format `x.y.z-rc-{COMMIT_HASH}`, this will allow us
  not to always bump the versions when merging PRs and also keeping the binaries deployed to our bucket.
- Update used libraries, to be able to compile under VS2017.
- XRP integration:
    - XRP Keychian, address derivation and account creation.
    - XRP API explorer and parser.
    - XRP Node explorer and parser.
    - Accounts synchronization.
    - XRP transaction serialization and parsing.
    - Tests of above features.

## 2.5.0

> 2019/01/22

- Resetting the libcore to its fresh state is now possible via the `WalletPool::freshResetAll`
  function.

## 2.4.0

> 2019/01/22

- Add the possibility to switch off the internal logger of libcore — this rely on the
  `DynamicObject` that now has a new boolean configuration, `"ENABLE_INTERNAL_LOGGING"`. Set it
  to `true` to enable the internal logging (default), otherwise, set to `false` to completely
  disable internal logging (this also will prevent the core library from creating log files).

## 2.3.0

> 2019/01/21

- Change the way the library is compiled and linked by using explicit interface libraries. This
  also fixes a Windows issues related to non-explicitly exported symbols.

### 2.2.1

> 2019/02/07

- Backport a patch to fix encryption password in `WalletPool`. A bug was introduced in previous
  version (not affecting production) that caused a non-empty string to be accepted by a
  `WalletPool`, yield encryption. As that should allow for explicit encryption with empty passwords,
  we forbid that and empty password will result in no encryption.

## 2.2.0

> 2019/01/15

- Add a new mechanism to `DatabaseEngine`. This allows custom database driver, which allow switching
  between database backends easier.'

## 2.1.0

> 2019/01/15

- Implement `Preferences` encryption via LevelDB. Only the values are encrypted. Be careful
  though: this change doesn’t provide a solution when you want to reset or change your password
  (already encrypted values will remain still). A fix for this is foreseen later.

## 2.0.0

> 2019/01/04

- Support of new coin family: Ethereum-like currencies, with an integration of Ethereum as first
  currency of this family.
- Support of ERC20 tokens.
- We do not support other smart contracts which are not ERC20 yet; to be more specific, internal
  transactions are not caught during synchronization of Ethereum accounts.

# 0.9.0

> 2018/05/14

- First beta release of libledger-core for Ledger Vault integration
