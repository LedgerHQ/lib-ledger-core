/*! \mainpage \image Official Ledger Core Library documentation
 *
 * ![](/logo.svg)
 *
 * Core library which will be used by Ledger applications.
 *
 * ## Clone project
 *
 * ```
 * git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core.git
 * ```
 *
 * ## Dependencies
 *
 * ### Build
 * This project is based on **cmake** as a build system so you should install it before starting (at least version 3.7).
 *
 * ### External dependencies:
 * * [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download) is needed to build tests of the library.
 * * Generation of binding is automated with [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni).
 * * Build on multiple Operating Systems is based on [polly](https://github.com/ruslo/polly) toolchains.
 *
 * ## Build of C++ library
 *
 * **cmake** is building out of source, you should create a build directory (e.g. `lib-ledger-core-build`):
 *
 *  .                           # Directory where clone command was launched
 *     ├── lib-ledger-core         # Source files directory
 *     ├── lib-ledger-core-build   # Build directory
 *
 * If you respect this folder structure (and naming), after `cd lib-ledger-core-build`, you can build the library by running:
 *
 * ```
 * cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/qt5 ../lib-ledger-core && make
 * ```
 *
 * ### Building for JNI
 *
 * Building with JNI (Java Native Interface), allows you to use the library with Java based software. In order to enable JNI mode use
 * ```
 * cmake -DTARGET_JNI=ON
 * ```
 *
 * This will add JNI files to the library compilation and remove tests. You need at least a JDK 7 to build for JNI (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
 *
 * ## Binding to node JS
 *
 * Generate binding (under `build/Release/ledgerapp_nodejs.node`):
 *
 * ```
 * npm i
 * ```
 *
 * ## Test NodeJs
 *
 * ```
 * node ledger-core-samples/nodejs/tests/wallet-pool-test.js
 * ```
